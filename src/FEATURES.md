## [Dashboard page](#dashboard)

The dashboard gives an overview of your funds, providing the values of:
- net worth, the total value of your tokens.
- total LP tokens value, the total value of your LP tokens.
- total staked, the amount of value you are currently staking.
- total fees, the amount you have spent on fees.

It also provides a plot showing the trend of your wallet and LP tokens total value against time.

## [Wallet page](#wallet)

This page provides a list of all the tokens you own, showing statistical information about them. Furthermore it allows to set telegram alerts regarding prices of single tokens (e.g. notify me when the price of token x exceeds threshold y).

## [Farming page](#farming)

The farming page allows you to track yields and losses of the pools you participate in; it does so by providing useful information such as:
- LP token value and distribution of underlying tokens.
- Yield from last deposit / withdraw.
- Current value of Impermanent Loss and hypothetical values of the tokens which lead to 0% of IL.
- Current fees for compounding and optimal compounding time. 
- Statistics on average compounding / harvesting timings and total amount paid in fees.

Moreover it is possible to set Telegram alerts regarding:
- Impermanent Loss values for pools (e.g. notify me when pool X/Y has IL lower than threshold x)
- Security issues about pools (e.g. scam, rug pull, hacks). Initially the alerts will be sent manually by the team, with the objective of automating it by aggregating multiple sources of data.

## [Analytics](#analytics)

The analytics page shows in-depth information about the single pools. It provides plot for:
- LP and relative tokens values trend against time, including the entry value at which you entered the pool.
- The trend of the APR of the pool against time.
- more to come.
